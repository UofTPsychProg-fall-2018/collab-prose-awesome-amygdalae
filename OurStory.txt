One day, 
I went for a walk. All of a sudden, a tiny puppy ran past me and toward the park. It was late, the sun had set, and I turned around to make sure the owner was close by. But there was no one around.

"Should I follow the puppy to make sure he's okay?" I thought to myself, worried. 

I waited around for a minute, then decided, "Screw it. I'm gonna follow that puppy and make sure it doesn't get into any trouble."

I slowly jogged toward the park. I spotted the puppy, who I nicknamed Scruffie, nosing around a gigantic oak tree. Relieved, I started to walk toward the tree,  but Scruffie suddenly bolted toward the pond. "Maybe he wants to go for a swim", I thought.

Little did I know that Scruffie couldn't swim...
