One day, 
I went for a walk. All of a sudden, a tiny chocolate lab puppy ran past me and toward the park. It was late, the sun had set, and I turned around to make sure the owner was close by. But there was no one around.

"Should I follow the puppy to make sure he's okay?" I thought to myself, worried. 

I waited around for a minute, then decided, "Screw it. I'm gonna follow that puppy and make sure it doesn't get into any trouble."

I slowly jogged toward the park. I spotted the puppy, who I nicknamed Scruffie, nosing around a gigantic oak tree. Relieved, I started to walk toward the tree,  but Scruffie ran the opposite of me. "I must've surprised him," I said to myself. 

Suddenly, Scruffie bolted toward the pond. "Maybe he wants to go for a swim", I thought.

He waded into the shallow end of the water. Little did I know that Scruffie couldn't swim...

Scruffie let out a little yelp as he suddenly found himself in the deeper and choppier side of the pond.

Without a second thought, I ran towards the Scruffie. "Oh god!" I cried, "Let me get to him in time!" 
The pond had only came up to my waist but I was sure it was a tough obstacle for a small creature like Scruffie.

A note: this story is so relatable lmao, I would follow a puppy around to make sure it was okay....To Be Continued...
